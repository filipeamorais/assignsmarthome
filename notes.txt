set classpath=.;org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3-1.2.0.jar


Sensor 1:
	-2 States
	-Broker: Remote or Local? Using Remote
	-Do I need to include MAC address? Needed for the MqttClient
	-Even haven set the classpath file for the lib I still needed to set the classpath on the command line to be able to compile.
	-To run the code through java command I had to go on a level upper from the code, at before app folder.
	-I couldnt make it work properly on the class project style so I went back to the single file folder format as done in class.

Sensor2:
	-There are two messages published, one turn on/off the lights and other to send the status of the lights.
	-Besides that, seems to be the same as Sensor1.

Sensor3:
	-There are two topics to publish, been the warning only related to extreme temperatures.
