set classpath=.;org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3-1.2.0.jar


Sensor 1:
	-2 States
	-Broker: Remote or Local? Using Remote
	-Do I need to include MAC address? Needed for the MqttClient
	-Even haven set the classpath file for the lib I still needed to set the classpath on the command line to be able to compile.
	-To run the code through java command I had to go on a level upper from the code, at before app folder.
	-I couldnt make it work properly on the class project style so I went back to the single file folder format as done in class.

Sensor2:
	-There are two messages published, one turn on/off the lights and other to send the status of the lights.
	-Besides that, seems to be the same as Sensor1.

Sensor3:
	-There are two topics to publish, been the warning only related to extreme temperatures.

Sensor4:
	-Publishes motion detected on montion
	-If not, publish off under lights
	-If motion detected when the owner is away publushes intruder detection under warning. (have to be subscribed to the topic of the owner)

04/03/2019-Until now: All of them are working but it seems when Sensor1 and Sensor2 are operational together at some point the connection crashes. I wonder if it could be for using a remote mqtt broker.
